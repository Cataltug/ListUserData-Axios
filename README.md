## Challenge: List User Data
- This React Native application demonstrates how to fetch and render a list of users from the JSONPlaceholder API using Axios. 
- It fetches data when the component first mounts and provides a button to reload fresh data on demand. 
- A loading indicator is displayed during network requests, and any errors are gracefully handled.

### Features
- Initial Data Fetch: Automatically retrieves user data once when the app loads.
- Reload Button: Press to fetch the data again at any time.
- Loading State: Shows an ActivityIndicator while data is being loaded.
- Error Handling: Displays an error message if the network request fails.
- Axios Integration: Uses Axios for promise-based HTTP requests.
